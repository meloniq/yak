CHANGELOG
=========

Version 1.6.0
-------------

 * Remove auto_set_quantity -- doesn't make sense since you can now perform all product setup from the edit post page.
 
 * Remove link back to project page.
 
 * Add custom "Out of Stock" message

 * Changes required so that YAK will work with WordPress MU
 
 * Move language files into "lang" subdirectory


Version 1.5.2
-------------

 * Remove help from YAK settings page.  Moved to the WordPress Extend page: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yak-for-wordpress/installation/
 
 * Add links to the plugin row
 
 * Fix bug in orders screen (hitting update doesn't requery)

 * Set the priority of YAK's post processing (can be changed by modifying the DEFINE in yak-static.php)


Version 1.5.1
-------------

 * Fix bug in sales report screen


Version 1.5.0
-------------

 * Fix shipping address in confirmation email, so that email and phone aren't included
 
 * Add translation hooks for admin interface.  There are now two base translation files: yak-XX.po and yak-admin-XX.po
   Most translators will probably only want to translate the customer interface (yak).  Those who want to translate the
   entire interface can also translate the admin interface as well (yak-admin).
 
 * Fix confirmation email for credit card orders and accounts receivable

 * Change accounts receivable button to "Next" rather than "Confirm", since it isn't the last page in the flow.

 * Fix translation bug in address screen

 * Add placeholder for third party integration. When order payment comes in, a function can be called which can (in turn)
   call third party scripts.  Basically, add a script yak_third_party.php in the yak plugin direction.  Add a function as follows:
   
    function yak_check_order_3p($order_id, $email, $recipient) {
        // your 3rd party integration here
    }
 
 * Add order export to Excel

 * Change the order screen so that it doesn't display orders without clicking the query button


Version 1.4.6
-------------

 * Add override for the shipping weight calculator value -- you can specify the value that is used for the first X grams
   in shipping calculation, and then the subsequent X grams.
 

Version 1.4.5.1
---------------

 * Missed a Git collision marker in yak-settings.php


Version 1.4.5
-------------

 * Localisation fix for the product page (patch provided by DjZoNe)

 * Fix a problem with the tests
 
 * Add facility to set session.cache_limiter to private for specific pages (such as checkout). This stops
   the "webpage has expired" messages in Internet Explorer.
 
 * Add promotion code access (specify a comma-separated list of user[name]s who are allowed to access a promotion)
 

Version 1.4.4
-------------

 * [html_shipping_address] no longer includes email address
 
 * billing address is now passed to PayPal Standard (shipping address was being sent through before)

 * add Portuguese translation provided by √Ålvaro


Version 1.4.3
-------------

 * wrong order for product type columns


11 May 2009
-----------

 * new tags for html emails: [html_order_detail] and [html_shipping_address] both of which output in html
   friendly format
   
 * format value sent to Authorize.net to enforce 2 decimal places


10 May 2009
-----------

 * add override for confirmation email subject
 
 * fix problem with checkboxes on settings screen


9 May 2009
----------

 * add [yak_back_to_cc] and [yak_back_to_address] tags to be used on an authorize.net or paypal error page (when payment
   processing returns an error)

 * add initial support for Google Analytics (including new tag [yak_google_analytics] for the final confirmation page).
 
 * add support for html confirmation emails


7 May 2009
----------

 * removed __autoload which was colliding with another plugin


4 May 2009
----------

 * add proper monetary formatting to total on cart
 
 * european money formatting was breaking the orders page
 
 * add facility to override the message displayed when the customer's basket is empty
 
 * add facility to embed customer details in the final confirmation page (after confirming order).
   The following tags are now available:
   
   [yak_customer_name]
   [yak_customer_phone]
   [yak_customer_address]


28 Apr 2009
-----------

 * initial version of current order widget
 
 RELEASE 1.3.7


27 Apr 2009
-----------

 * fix bug with updating product quantity - updproduct function is being fired twice causing an incorrect
   quantity to be applied


23 Apr 2009
-----------
 
 * fix bug in quantity tag
 
 * fix bug in shipping settings
 
 * add test for enabled countries

RELEASE 1.3.6


17 Apr 2009
-----------

 * Add options to specify decimal point symbol (i.e. dot or comma) and thousands separator in money formatting.
 

14 Apr 2009
-----------

 * Add facility special instructions (main part of code provided by 52teas.com).  Basically, enter default special
   instructions in Yak settings, and an input box will appear on the final shopping cart confirmation screen,
   to allow a customer to enter additional shipping instructions, or other info pertinent to the order.


13 Apr 2009
-----------

 * Change shipping to allow for first and subsequent items, and to extend the default options.  The new 
   shipping values are thus:
 
        + default total fixed shipping for order
        + default fixed shipping per item (first item and subsequent items)
        + default shipping by weight (first 100 grams and subsequently per 100 grams)
        + total fixed shipping for order by country
        + fixed shipping per item (first and subsequent items) by country
        + shipping by weight (first 100 grams and subsequently per 100 grams) by country

   If you've already set shipping by weight values, please record them before updating to the latest version. The 
   current values will vanish after the upgrade because the attribute names are changing.

 * Add "Edit this address" button to the address entry form.  This takes a previously entered address and copies
   the values to the new address input boxes -- so in the event of a minor change, a customer doesn't have to re-enter
   all their details.


12 Apr 2009
-----------

 * Add parameter to buy button so you can specify the post/product id in the same was as you can do in the yak_price
   and quantity tags.  For example, both of the following are now valid.
   
        [yak_buy]
    
        [yak_buy 10]
    
   This means that the split buy-button tags need to change.  So if you use these tags, they now change to:
   
        [yak_sbuy_begin]
        [yak_sbuy_content]
        [yak_sbuy_end]


11 Apr 2009
-----------

 * fix nasty problem with the [yak_product_page] function, add selenium test


10 Apr 2009
-----------

 * Add install instructions to settings page.
 
 * Release 1.3.3


9 Apr 2009
----------

 * Left some PHP5-only code in place.  Changed to PHP4 friendly version.


3 Apr 2009
----------

 * Fix a problem with single-quotes (') in addresses

 * Add Selenium tests for automating the test process (finally!!!)
 

2 Apr 2009
----------

 * Change the wording of the button on the CC form to "Next" rather than "Confirm", as the latter may imply that
   it's the final step of the order flow, instead of the second-to-last.
   
 * Bug fix for new product type entry, so it's not displayed on editing the page
 
 * Change [yak_quantity] and [yak_price] tags so that they take params. The existing style was either [yak_quantity] or 
   [yak_quantity_PRODUCTYPE] (e.g. [yak_quantity_large]).  The new param method takes the type and (optionally)
   the product id (to override the current product, if necessary).  The following tags are now accepted:
   
   [yak_quantity]
   [yak_quantity TYPE]          (e.g. [yak_quantity large])
   [yak_quantity TYPE PRODUCTID]   (e.g. [yak_quantity large 21])
   
   [yak_price]
   [yak_price TYPE]             (e.g. [yak_price large])
   [yak_price TYPE PRODUCTID]      (e.g. [yak_price large 21])

   (note: where PRODUCTID is the page or post id for your product)
   
   Added yak_std_price back in for non-discounted prices (you can now use [yak_std_price] in the same
   way as [yak_price])


1 Apr 2009
----------

 * Add facility to choose the type of order number: either generated (randomised) or plain sequence (linked to
   the order record). No, this isn't an April Fool's Joke, someone did actually ask for it.

 * Fix a problem with PayPal Pro -- requires address and name details now (didn't seem to before)

 * If the customer is logged into WordPress, record the user_id against the order

 * Fix zero total orders (don't submit to the payment gateway, rather redirect to success url)
   Note: this won't work for Google Checkout at the moment.


30 Mar 2009
-----------

 * Add polish translation provided by Marciej
 
 * New facility to add product types from the Products screen and when editing a post
 
 * Remove old sql files, tidy up translation resources, and re-order resource 
   files such as javascript and stylesheet files



22 Mar 2009
-----------

 * Update swedish translation provided by Marco



21 Mar 2009
-----------

 * remove unneeded yak_empty function (replace with php empty)
 
 * fix charset/collation on YAK tables so they're consistent with WP



12 Mar 2009
-----------

 * fix incorrect billing/shipping address message
 
 * add Swedish translation, fix minor product title problem



28 Feb 2009
-----------

 * fixed state handling for Canada shipping addresses (problems in PayPal)
 
 * fixed county handling for UK shipping addresses (again, problems in PayPal)



11 Feb 2009
-----------

 * Fix broken address handling (again).  State code was being sent thru to PayPal, no matter what.



01 Feb 2009
-----------

 * send state and zip code to PayPal for US addresses

 * add state to address form

 * add more filtering to order admin (filter by date, and order number)

 * added Norwegian translation, provided by Tom Boersma

 * added updated French translation provided by Romaric Drigon
 
 * Fix dodgy address handling, explicitly store country codes (shipping+billing), 
   which was causing a problem in PayPal



13 Dec 2008
-----------

 * add basic xml feed for yak products

 * add yak_get_remote function for retrieving the content of a product from another yak store.  The basic usage is:

    [yak_get_remote_n] where "n" is the number of the post.
    
    For example:
    
    [yak_get_remote_9]
    
    The limitations of this function are:
    
        a) it will probably only work if you have libcurl enabled in PHP (especially if you are using permalinks) and, 
        b) because there is no affiliate functionality in YAK, there is no way to redirect back to the calling site.

 * add check for referrer, so clicking on a buy button from a remotely displayed product will then display "Back to [blogtitle]"
   on the checkout
    
 * add Accounts Receivable payment type.  You can specify a special type of Accounts Receivable, and a landing page.  
   A simple form is displayed during the checkout process which allows the customer to enter their A/R number and name.  
   After that (similar to the basic credit card processing) you manually process the payment.
    
 * add initial support for the Authorize.net payments gateway

 * add initial support for PayPal Payments Pro

 * fix price formatting in confirmation message

 * fix minor problem in reports

 * fix minor layout issue with out of stock message

 * fix minor problem with WP2.7 layout



02 Oct 2008
-----------

 * add Czech translation provided by Frank
 
 * add override price functionality for product types
 
 * tidy up column classes in checkout
 
 * add promotional code functionality
 
 * add Spanish translation, provided by Josep

 * Fix security flaw in cart with shipping
 
 * Fix minor issue with page products and the override price functionality



14 Jul 2008
-----------

 * "Hard-code" the PayPal IPN page.  This means you don't need to create it manually.  Instead
   just specify:
     
        http://yourdomain.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/yak-for-wordpress/yak-paypal-ipn.php

 * Add Italian translation, provided by Roberto Mogliotti
 
 * Change download message to use a tag [downloads] rather than a code.
 
 * Change email confirmation to use tags rather than codes.

 * Fix nasty problem zeroing price and alternate title when commenting on a product.

 * Fix problem with random order number.



10 Jul 2008
-----------


 * Add https support
 
 * Add first cut of Google Checkout integration.  
 
 * Tidy up setting payment types.  Add credit card landing page.
 
 * Add support for tags with square brackets [ ].  The html-comment version of tags will be removed in
   an upcoming release.

 * Fix non-unique order id (wasn't very useful).



06 Sep 2007 (and older)
-----------------------

 * added traditional Chinese message file (provided by Ronny).
 
 * added new about page
 
 * new special options -- use for offers of free gifts with certain products

 * configurable shipping address (turn on/off name, phone number, address and separate billing address)
 
 * http proxy for curl backend requests (such as PayPal).  Useful for hosts such as GoDaddy (for which the
   proxy address should apparently be set to: "http://proxy.shr.secureserver.net:3128")
     
 * update to Thai language file
 
 * change all syslog references to error_log (so debugging messages end up in the apache log file)
 
 * added Slovak translation file (provided by Franti≈°ek Malina)

 * fix reports to show figures for stock sent orders (instead of everything)
 
 * fix a problem using a page as a product
 
 * fix problems with sending email confirmations (was using the wrong email address for download notifications)
 
 * fix problem with products having a quantity of null (causes weird issues if a customer already has that product in
   their basket and the quantity is set to an empty value)

-----------

 * new shipping options -- now 2 ways to specify shipping costs:
 
        a) fixed cost. ie. one fixed price no matter how much a customer buys
        b) by weight.  calculated based on the weight of the products
     
   note: this also means that you now need to specify a weight for your products

 * added placeholder for using a customer's name in the confirmation email
   (see the yak options page for more info).
     
 * hide product types on the yak products screen, to make dealing with large numbers
   of products easier.
     
 * title sort order on Yak Products screen.
 
 * add yak.js to yak_head instead of including in specific admin pages
 
 * flexible list of payment types -- where payments before were fixed to Deposit, Cheque,
   Credit Card, and Paypal.  Now these are completely flexible, although this now means
   you need to enter these by hand.
 
 * tidy up the options screen

 * add a 'note' input box to yak orders -- so you can add comments to the order log.

 * consolidated admin screens into one (now with 4 sub menus)

 * new reports screen showing total sales, sales by month, top 5 best sellers for the year,
   and top 5 best sellers per month 

 * removed internationalisation code from the admin screens.  adding a new language should now require
   less effort on the part of the translator.  see yak-XX.po for a list of the keys.

 * added Japanese translation file (contributed by Ronny at mobitemple.net)

 * fix problem with product posts which have no alternate title
 
 * complete compatibility changes for WP2.1
 
 * change confirmation mail function back to using standard php mail() rather than wp_mail

 * missing weight column in create statement for product details table


-----------


 * added delete button for products in the shopping cart (requires javascript)

 * change cart buttons to use an html <button> tag, rather than <input type="image">.  This means button text
   can be easily localised, colors changed, etc.
   
   For example, if you want to change the default orange background buttons with plain (default) grey,
   replace the button style in yak.css:
   
        button {
            background-color: #fbc442;
            border-top: 1px solid lightgrey;
            border-left: 1px solid lightgrey;
            border-right: 1px solid black;
            border-bottom: 1px solid black;
        }
        
   with:
   
        button {
        }
   
   If you want buttons with a black background (using an image for example), change the style to the following:
   
        button {
            border: 0px;
            background: url('images/blackbg.png');
            border-left: lightgrey;
            border-right: lightgrey;
            background-color: transparent;
            color: white;
        }
        
 * added German translation files provided by MK.
        
 * fix download filename in IE

 * fix problem with download emails not being sent when updating the received funds in the yak orders screen.

 * fix problem with shipping cost being zeroed when the available quantity of a product is less than the order quantity.


-----------


 * Add new non-unique order id
 
 * Move javascript on cart off page and into separate script.  split javascript into generic and admin specific
   files -- to stop problems with (missing) jquery on the wp pages.
     
 * Add warning message for people with session.auto_start turned on.
 
 * Integrate YAK back into the WordPress menu structure.  The top-level menu was a nice idea, but it's inconsistent
   with all other plugins (plus isn't recommended, according to the WP devs).  You can now get to YAK's options
   through Settings->Yak, and to Orders/Products/Sales Reports from the Manage menu.

 * Fix PHP4 problem with the view products screen
 

-----------


 * Frank Malina's new look-and-feel.
 
 * French translation (provided by Charles Dixon-Spain).
 
 * Change money format and currency format to be simpler drop down boxes.
 
 * Change the download url from the settings screen so it is now an override (i.e. optional).

 * Add new data input on the post/page edit screen for yak price and title (replacing the old
   method of using custom fields).
 
 * Remove the "Auto Set Price" option (doesn't make a huge amount of sense now).
 
 * Fix the Auto Set Quantity so it works with selected categories.
 
 * Tidy up the stylesheet.
 
 * Add a hidden link to the checkout and to the buy button form -- vain hope that this might drive
   more search engine traffic to the YAK plugin page -- if you don't want the link included, it can
   be switched off on the Basic settings page.
    
 * Change the product category (settings page) from an input box to a dropdown.
 
 * Change the redirect on buy (setting page) from an input box to a dropdown.
 
 * Change the return and cancel urls on the PayPal settings page to a dropdown so you can select a page
   rather than having to type a url.

 * Problem with table creation.
 
 * Country options not saving properly.
 
 * Fix an odd problem with globals.

 * The return URL appears to be broken with PayPal IPN.  PDT works fine, but IPN seems to wind up back at the 
   home page of the blog.  Added a fix to cleanup the order from the shopping cart when this happens.


-----------


 * automatically set status to STOCK SENT when received all funds for a PayPal order, if the order contains
   only downloadable items

 * change directory structure to yak-for-wordpress, rather than just yak, as this is what the WordPress plugin site
   automatically generates in the download file.

   Reinstallation now requires:

           a) backup your full wp installation
           b) deactivate old version of YAK from the plugins page
           c) remove old directory "yak"
           d) extract contents of new distribution (directory "yak-for-wordpress" is created)
           e) reactivate YAK

 * Remove 'default' category from products drop down.  This means you can still turn the drop-down on by default
   for products with more than one option, and the products that are tagged as 'default', won't include the dropdown.

 * Tidied up the confirmation email -- removed the table structure which wasn't working for most people, and replaced
   with a simpler list.

 * fix problem with apostrophes in yak title, download and confirmation email

 * fix problem with PayPal shipping on multiple items

 * fix problem with PayPal verification (item names need to be properly encoded)

 * another go at fixing PayPal shipping

 * fixed invalid reference to yak.php on activation. 


-----------


 * update YAK to be compatible with WP2.3
 
 * add paging to the "Products page"
 
 * add facility for available countries to be switched on and off from the options page
 
 * add <!--yak_quantity--> tag for displaying the quantity of a product to a customer
 
 * fix problem with shipping cost zeroed on a credit card order


-----------


 * new method to support talking to paypal (or potentially other providers) using CURL or fsockopen (if CURL is not available).
 
 * cancel an order on the order page, and the item quantities are added back to the quantity-available for each product.
 
 * tidied up order page, adding a button for showing more detail plus added log info for orders.
 
 * new credit card payment form (for shops which don't use a 3rd party to process credit card purchases)
   NOTE: if you cancel or send stock from the orders screen, the credit card number is blanked out (to stop long term
   storage of credit card details -- which is, after all, a potential security risk).
 
 * yak_quantity function has been removed -- it doesn't make sense with multi-option products.
 
 * removed requirement for using the execphp / phpexec plugins.  this was causing some layout problems (putting <br />'s 
   where I didn't want them), and adds unnecessary overhead if it's not needed for anything else.  This basically changes
   all <?php function_call() ?> code in pages & posts to <!--function_call-->.  The documentation will be updated 
   to reflect the new way to include YAK functionality.
   
 * added shipping address to confirmation email
   
 * fix for Sourceforge bug #1594909 (redirect under IIS results in blank page)
 
 * fix for various problems with paypal notifications
 
 * fix for Sourceforge bug #1583319 (hosts with no support for CURL)
 
 * problem with one create table statement
 
 * changed the order_value function to use a session var rather than url parameter.  The old method allowed anyone to
   view an order value (i.e. they can see exactly how much each order was, just by knowing the order id numbers).
   
 * finally remembered to update the version number in the plugin header... sigh
 
 * added facility to switch of product options drop down if only 1 product
   option is available

 * fix problem with auto pricing
 
 * more easily configurable button images
 
 * add missing create table to upgrade script (not really necessary, but more complete if there)
 
 * begin work to make YAK compatible with WordPress 2.1


-----------


 * added facility for specifying PayPal currency codes
 
 * yak_install is now called only once, on plugin activation
 
 * initial work adding filtering to orders page (at the moment, just showing fulfilled and unfulfilled orders)
 
 * change paypal pdt to use mc_gross rather than payment_gross as payment_gross is deprecated (yak code still checks for
   payment_gross field, if mc_gross isn't present for some reason)
   
 * fixed issue where posts weren't appearing on the products page even when the set default option was set
 
 * problem with default "now()" for tables.  This is not supported in older versions of MySQL
 
 * tidy up code, adding function_exists
 
 * problem with "Allowed memory size" on certain default installs of PHP.  The answer seems to be to add
   "ini_set" to the beginning of the script -- but not sure if this is the right solution.
   
 * products attached to pages (i.e. static content) were not clickable in the shopping cart (basically it
   would try to go to a post with that id, rather than a page)

 * shipping cost wasn't being included in the order value (function wp_yak_get_order_value)


-----------


 * yak_price now used as the required field for whether to display a post as a product or not
 
 * yak_title is now optional.  if not present, the post title is used

 * added the ability to automatically set a default price and quantity for all newly -published- posts.
   If you turn these options on, you'll have to specifically delete the custom fields (yak_price, yak_quantity)
   for posts that you don't want to be products.
 
 * added the payment type to the order table and displayed in the order screen
 
 * added facility for download content

 * fixed problem, on some versions of WP, where the products screen was failing with a SQL error message.
 
 * information messages on the Options screen were a bit 'screwy'

 
-----------


 * Added css class (yak_order) to shopping cart "confirm" screen for the table.  Added same to yak.css

 * Added confirmation message (for email confirmation)
 
 * Added phone number to address screen, plus new option to specify whether this field should be optional
     or mandatory.

 * Remove javascript dependence for validating shipping addresses
 
 * Re-layout of confirmation email (still not brilliant... but perhaps slightly better)
 
 * Products with an apostrophe in the yak_title field were failing to insert.  Added a function to call the mysql escaping function.

 * Fix spelling mistake (recipient was spelled incorrectly)


-----------


 * Removed requirement to specify parameters for buy button.

 * Add support for pages as well as posts

 * New functions yak_price and yak_quantity to retrieve that data and include it in an entry (rather than specify the price as a custom field as well as in a post)

 * Moved configuration to separate php file

 * Added shipping cost into order table (it was missing)

 * New online payment option (PayPal)

 * Order log table (not currently viewable from within WP)

 * New functions yak_get_order_value (to get the value of an order) and yak_get_order_id (to
   display the order ID/number)



26 May 2006
-----------

 * Remove javascript dependence for validating shipping addresses

 * Re-layout confirmation email (still not brilliant...)



17 May 2006
-----------

 * Added phone number to address screen, plus new option to specify whether this field should be optional
   or mandatory.



15 May 2006
-----------

 * Added confirmation message (for email confirmation)



30 Apr 2006
-----------

  * Add css class (yak_order) to shopping cart "confirm" screen for the table.  Added same to yak.css



28 Apr 2006
-----------

* Added options page for most options currently set in yak_config.php.

* Removed yak_config.php



25 Apr 2006
-----------

 * Moved "yak orders" to the "Manage" pages

 * Added a new "yak products" management page.  After a product is added it will appear here.  This provides 
   a shortcut, when updating quantities/prices/titles, so that you don't need to go from post to post. 

 * Added email notification for orders



23 Apr 2006
-----------

* Remove <p> tags from buy button, so it works in different layouts better.  Changed to a span with a class
  of yak_buyerror.  Also split the buy button function into 3 (a begin -- which writes out the beginning of the
  form, content -- which writes the actual button image, and end -- which closes the form).  You can still use
  the yak_buybutton() function, but if you have layout problems (like I'm getting), you can split the calls
  up and use:

     <?php yak_buybutton_begin(); ?>

     ... more content here ...

     <?php yak_buybutton_content(); ?> (the actual button)

     ... more content ...

     <?php yak_buybutton_end(); ?>

* Added new product page function, for displaying all products in the system

* added AUTO_DISCOUNT constant if you want to automatically discount the price of your products sold online.
  yak_price now shows the discounted price, unless you call yak_price(false)

* Changed the default 'Add to Shopping Cart' button to the small shopping cart icon, as someone suggested it
  looked better.



04 Apr 2006
-----------

 * Function paypal_idn is renamed to paypal_ipn (as it should have been originally)

 * Added PDT (Payment Data Transfer) for PayPal notifications

 * Fixed problem with quantity not submitting correctly to PayPal (introduced in the last exp release)



31 Mar 2006
-----------

 * Refactor view code into separate view files

 * Add anchor so buy button stays in view when clicked on



30 Mar 2006
-----------

 * Fixed problem where "Out of Stock" message was display even on items with no yak_* fields set

 * Removed the requirement to manual include the stylesheet in the header
